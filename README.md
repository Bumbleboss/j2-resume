> ## An opinionated workflow to produce different versions of a Curriculum Vitae (rèsumè) document using different templates, styles and formats without having to mantain them all.

![Architecture](.meta/flow.svg)

## Goals

- Have an agnostic data source (JSON) and edit ONLY that when updating the informations (API access to a remote endpoint exposing a compliant JSON is trivially implementable, too).
- Have data source compliant and validated against a formal specification or schema (use JSON schema and possibly the JSON-Resume specification?). Templates must respect this schema too.
- Easily update and version the data source using a text editor or a (visual) JSON editor;
- Keep the hybrid Jinja2 templates clean and similar to their plain format versions;


## Requirements

- a TeX distribution
- XeLaTeX

On Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install texlive-base pandoc
```

## Build

### LaTeX TeX/J2 template

```bash
python j2tex.py
xelatex cv_render.tex
```

### VueJS web version

TODO

### markdown/pandoc exports

TODO


## Related projects

If you wish to remain sane, it may be healtier to use something like [pandoc-resume](https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume) (BUT it doesn't provide a serialized data source, it's markdown).
