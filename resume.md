Side Projects
:   I've worked in a number of side project in which I implemented full stack applications using a lot of different programming languages, frameworks and different technologies, everytime looking for another challenge. I worked alone, in a team, and lead open source projects raised or wanted by the community.

Open Source
:   I partecipate in civic-hacking projects, I love producing quality documentation for the community and everything I worked on is available with an Open Source license.

Web
:   I worked and learnt a lot of backend and frontend frameworks, CMS, and various components. I extensively used Wordpress, Node (with Express and Fastify), Bootstrap 3 and 4, MaterializeCSS and more. 

Languages
:   In university I had the chance to work on assignments and course projects using Prolog and LISP (Programming Paradigms), Ruby (Computational Biology), R (Statistics) and C (Embedded Systems). Personally I really love Javascript (and its Node ecosystem).

Hobbies
:   Old school hardware/software, photography, typography and electronics.
