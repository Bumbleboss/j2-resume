\section{Side Projects}
I've worked in a number of side project in which I implemented full stack applications using a lot of different programming languages, frameworks and different technologies, everytime looking for another challenge. I worked alone, in a team, and lead open source projects raised or wanted by the community.

\section{Open Source}
I partecipate in civic-hacking projects, I love producing quality documentation for the community and everything I worked on is available with an Open Source license.

\section{Web}
I worked and learnt a lot of backend and frontend frameworks, CMS, and various components. I developed entire projects taking care of the full stack, extensively using Wordpress, Node (with Express.js), Bootstrap 3 and 4, MaterializeCSS, MongoDB (and mongoose), MySQL, sqlite and more.

\section{Languages}
In university I had the chance to work on assignments and course projects using Prolog and LISP (Programming Paradigms), Ruby (Computational Biology), R (Statistics) and C (Embedded Systems). Personally I really love Javascript, Node and its community plugin ecosystem.

\section{Hobbies}
Old school hardware/software, photography, typography and electronics.
